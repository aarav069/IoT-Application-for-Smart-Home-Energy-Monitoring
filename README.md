# 🔋 Smart Home Energy Monitoring System  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Smart Home Energy Monitoring System** is an IoT-powered solution that helps users track real-time energy consumption of household appliances, visualize usage trends, and set energy budgets with alerts. The system consists of:  
- A **ReactJS** frontend for data visualization and user interaction.  
- A **Java Spring Boot** backend for data processing and API management.  
- **PostgreSQL/MongoDB** for efficient data storage.  
- Integration with IoT platforms (AWS IoT Core, GCP IoT, or simulated devices).  
- Deployment using **Kubernetes (k8s) and Docker**.
